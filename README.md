# GeoSnap - Location-Based Photo Fetching Service
GeoSnap is a demo Swift app that dynamically fetches photos from the Flickr API based on the user’s real-time location. Using Core Location, the app tracks the user’s movements and retrieves new photos when they travel more than 200 meters. This project is designed to showcase clean code architecture with SOLID principles and seamless integration with external APIs.

## Features

•	Location-Based Photo Retrieval: Fetches photos from Flickr using the user’s geographic coordinates.

•	Dynamic Updates: The app refreshes the photos each time the user moves 200 meters or more.

•	Modular Architecture: The app follows SOLID principles, making it easy to extend and maintain.

•	Swift and Core Location: Demonstrates best practices for using Core Location and making API calls with URLSession.



## Technologies Used

•	Swift: The primary language used for the app.

•	Core Location: For tracking the user’s location in real-time.

•	URLSession: For making network requests to the Flickr API.

•	JSON Parsing: To handle API responses from Flickr.

•	SOLID Principles: For writing clean, maintainable, and extendable code.
